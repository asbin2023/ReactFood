# ReactFood

<strong>
  The frontend uses Tailwind CSS for styling, context API for state management, and custom hooks for data fetching.
</strong>
<br/>
<hr/>
<p>
  The backend structure was provided by Maximilian Schwarzmüller's React course.
<p>
  Design elements such as images, font colors, background colors, and animations were copied from Maximilian Schwarzmüller's course materials.
</p>
<p>All other aspects of the design, including layout, structure, and additional styling, were created by myself using Tailwind CSS.</p>
